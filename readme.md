Yggflexisil is a flexible circuit tree with 20 blue LED leafs on it. The leds are charlieplexed and the ATtiny85 is running the code to blink them.

This repository contains all of the files needed for the project: the 3d print designs, pcb layouts in gEDA, code. Also includes the 3d etch resist files, if you were thinking of fabricating it in the same way.

If you want to see some of the "making of" photos and descriptions, please see [our wiki](http://robophoenix.dreamhosters.com/index.php?title=Yggflexisil).
